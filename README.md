# Dart reduce() method error on empty list

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in Dart related to the `reduce()` method when used with an empty list. The `reduce()` method requires at least one element to perform the reduction operation.  Attempting to use it on an empty list will result in a runtime error.  This example shows how to handle this edge case effectively.
